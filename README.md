Configurable operations dashboard designed to bring together the
disparate datasources that operations teams need to manage and present
them in a flexible and beautiful way.

The current version provides ad-hoc searching of data, with OpenTSDB as
the initially available data source. It allows for searching multiple
metrics, week-over-week display, and anomaly detection in the current data.
